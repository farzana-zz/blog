Simple contact form plug-in provides a simple Ajax based contact form on your wordpress website side bar. User entered details are stored into database and at the same time admin will get email notification regarding the new entry. And we have option to stop sending emails to admin. This plug-in generates images (known as "Captcha's") which contain security codes used for protecting a form from spam.
 
1. Simple.  
2. Admin can choose which page this plugin should display.  
3. Easy style-override.
4. Widget, so you can add pretty much anything.
